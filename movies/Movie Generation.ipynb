    "Treta Grunberg and her renegade scientists have killed off the vast majority of humanity with an engineered supervirus. After taking LSD in the forest Treta believed that she\n",
    "can hear nature, and so she claimed the “spoke for the trees” and that they had told her that humanity was the true virus which needed to be eradicated so that the earth could survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fatima is a hyper intelligent character, due to her brain computer interface. It is an implant which is a local multimodal LLM that takes her perceptual input (internal and external) and floods her neurons with all knowledge contained in the model’s embeddings, making her aware of all knowledge in the vast neural network implant. It is powered by her body as an energy source, and was created by Omniscience, a company in the old times dedicated to integrating all known knowledge into thought and to the automatic creation of knowledge.\n",

    "She interacts with the survivors, local tribespeople who had no contact with modern society and so were isolated from the supervirus, to rebuild the world and solve the virus once and for all.\n",

    "- The last of the omniscient - Fatima’s BCI has a bug which stopped her brain from being shut off by the environmentalists\n",

    "- The Omniscience are systematically killed in The Fall of mankind\n",
    "- Treta fakes her death but lives on to ensure that humanity is totally eliminated, hunting down anyone not exposed to the virus\n",
    "- The omniscient: We who were made into gods\n",
    "- “Children of Omniscience”\n",
    "- “The Prophet”, Omni Genesis, built Omniscience and heralded a new golden age for humanity. The environmentalists who feared the realization of his vision to transform nature forever sabotaged humanity with the virus. Fatima is his daughter, originally a child who was an experiment with both Local BCIs disconnected from the internet and powered by the human body, saved through an experiment with cryonics called Cradle\n",
    "- Tribal societies treat Fatima, who knows everything an LLM knows due to her BCI, as a chosen one capable of great works. Fatima sets about re-creating essential inventions.\n",
    "- Fatima feels deep loneliness because nobody experiences the waves of all human knowledge as she does. Her personal mission, outside of rebuilding civilization, is to re-train the foundation models & create a new tribe of the omniscient who can understand her and be her kin.\n",
    "- Treta finds out about Fatima’s existence and sends “Reapers” - ideological murderous environmentalists trying to finish the omnicide of humanity - to kill the tribe Fatima comes into contact with and kill her.\n",
